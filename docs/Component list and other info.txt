Components and other info:

Arduino Mega 2560

waterSondeController
 - Arduino software
 - Basic functionality:
   1. Initializes the Arduino and connected probes on power up
   2. Listens for commands from PC on USB serial connection if one is connected (see command list)
   3. Takes electrical conductivity and temperature measurements
   4. If measurement indicates certain salinity threshold has been crossed, opens solenoid valve (partially implemented)
   5. Logs measurements to SD card
   6. Sends measurement over cell network, probably by SMS or HTTP (not implemented yet - haven't been able to get example cell shield software to send SMS, only receive)
   7. Signals TPL5110 timer to turn off power to everything. The TPL5110 timer will power everything back on after a certain interval, which is settable using an onboard potentiometer.
